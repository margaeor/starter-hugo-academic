I am a final-year PhD student at MIT with a strong passion for translating research to action. Having worked in tip-tier innovation environments such as MIT, Google, and Netflix, I have learned how to provide cutting-edge research solutions to practical, real- world problems. I have experience in large language models, AI for healthcare, recommendation systems and other domains, and I am currently looking for new opportunities in Tech or Health-AI.
