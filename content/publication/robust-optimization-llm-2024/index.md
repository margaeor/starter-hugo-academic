<!-- ## Abstract

We present a novel approach to robust and adaptive optimization that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. Our framework combines traditional robust optimization techniques with the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to provide more interpretable and flexible solutions to complex optimization problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark problems and real-world applications.

## Key Contributions

- **LLM Integration**: Novel combination of robust optimization with large language models
- **Interpretability**: Enhanced interpretability through natural language explanations
- **Adaptive Solutions**: More flexible solutions that adapt to changing conditions
- **Real-world Applications**: Demonstrated effectiveness on practical optimization problems
