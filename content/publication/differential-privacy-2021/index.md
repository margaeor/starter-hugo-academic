# Abstract and shortened version.
abstract: "This thesis presents a novel approach to differentially private data synthesis using variational autoencoders (VAEs). We develop a framework that generates synthetic data while preserving privacy guarantees through differential privacy mechanisms. Our approach combines the generative capabilities of VAEs with rigorous privacy protection, enabling the creation of useful synthetic datasets for research and analysis while maintaining individual privacy."

<!-- ## Abstract

This thesis presents a novel approach to differentially private data synthesis using variational autoencoders (VAEs). We develop a framework that generates synthetic data while preserving privacy guarantees through differential privacy mechanisms. Our approach combines the generative capabilities of VAEs with rigorous privacy protection, enabling the creation of useful synthetic datasets for research and analysis while maintaining individual privacy.

## Key Contributions

- **Privacy-Preserving Synthesis**: Novel framework for generating synthetic data with differential privacy
- **VAE Integration**: Effective combination of variational autoencoders with privacy mechanisms
- **Theoretical Analysis**: Rigorous privacy guarantees and theoretical foundations
- **Practical Implementation**: Demonstrated effectiveness on real-world datasets -->
